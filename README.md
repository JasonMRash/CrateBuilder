# Crate Builder

v1.0 located at https://crate-builder.herokuapp.com/

A web app built with Flask, and Bootstrap to help build crate drawings based on a crate template.

The idea for the project came about when I was creating shipping crate drawings using SOLIDWORKS (3D CAD design software).  Whenever an international order came the internal dimensions of a crate would be given to me to build crate drawings, so ISPM 15 compliant shipping crates could be ordered.  This would require me to drop everything I was working on and build the model of the crate and make the drawings.  While taking my first Computer Science course through Oregon State University, I came up with a C++ console program that worked to do this.  I decided to replicate that C++ project to build my first web app.
