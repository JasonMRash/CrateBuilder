        <p><strong>Crate Builder</strong> by Jason Rash</p>
        
        <p>The idea for the project came about when I was creating shipping crate drawings using SOLIDWORKS (3D CAD design software).  
        Whenever an international order came the internal dimensions of a crate would be given to me to build crate drawings, so ISPM 
        15 compliant shipping crates could be ordered.  This would require me to drop everything I was working on and build the model 
        of the crate and make the drawings.  While taking my first Computer Science course through Oregon State University, I came up 
        with a C++ console program that worked to do this.  I decided to replicate that C++ project to build my first web app.
